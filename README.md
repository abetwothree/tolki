# Tolki JS

Use the PHP Laravel framework utilities in your JavaScript projects.

## Backstory

I love [Laravel](https://laravel.com/). I love JavaScript [frontend frameworks](https://vuejs.org/). [Inertia](https://inertiajs.com/) bridged the gap between these two worlds. I just wish I could use the incredible helper functions that Laravel provides in my JavaScript code with proper TypeScript support and tree-shaking capabilities.

After making them, I then decided to open-source these utilities so that others could benefit from them as well. Thus, the Tolki JS project was born.
