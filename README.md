# Zinaid JS

Use the PHP Laravel framework utilities in your JavaScript projects.

## Backstory

I love the Laravel PHP framework utilities. I love frontend frameworks like Vue. I love using Inertia JS to bridge the two. However, I missed the ability to use Laravel-like utilities in my JavaScript code. So, I ported multiple Laravel utilities to TypeScript so that I could use them in my projects.

I thus decided to open-source these utilities so that others could benefit from them as well. Thus, the Zinaid JS project was born.
