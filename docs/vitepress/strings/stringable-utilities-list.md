# Tolki Stringable Utilities List

## Stringable utilities list

The documentation for fluent string utilities is in the works. In the meantime, I recommend checking out the Laravel documentation for [Fluent strings](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/strings#fluent-strings-method-list) since the JavaScript utilities are designed to mirror the Laravel ones as closely as possible. 

You're also welcomed to checkout the [source code](https://github.com/abetwothree/tolki/blob/master/packages/str/src/stringable/index.ts) for the list of available utilities.
