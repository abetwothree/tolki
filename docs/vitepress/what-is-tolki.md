# What is "Tolki"?

To be honest, I needed a name for the packages and it took me legit weeks to come up with one. I didn't want to use the name "Laravel" as part of this project's name because "Laravel" is trademarked and I didn't want to infringe on that.

So I googled and looked up words in different languages that were short and easy to type out. I ended up on tolki as it is a bit derivative from Nahuatl's (the language of the Aztecs) tōlli. It can be pronounced as "TOHL-kee" or "TOHLK-ee".

So that's it. Not much more deep meaning than that. Just a short, easy to type name that isn't already taken on npm.
