# List of Packages

One of the problems with existing utility libraries is that they only implement a subset of the functionality that Laravel provides. Tolki JS Utilities aims to provide a more complete set of utilities that allow for a more cohesive set of packages that can be used together.

Currently, only the string, number, and some TypeScript utilities are available. However, the work on arrays, objects, and collections is underway.
